.Sh Parts of a PR
The first tab contains user info, as well as SMTP settings. Do not forget 
to properly set the SMTP server, or the program will fail when trying to 
send the PR. If the server requires SMTP AUTH, you will be prompted for a user
name and password. If the server runs on a non-standard port (other than 25), set the port
to the appropriate value. You can enable SSL by setting the SSL option to 
.Do

.Dc or
.Do
Always Use SSL
.Dc . The program expects a file containing both your private RSA key and your certificate to be 
located at 
.Pa ~/.authenticate/private/smtp-starttls.pem
, whith permissions set to 0600 or 0400, otherwise it will be ignored by libesmtp. Password 
protected certificates are not yet supported. Users should not modify the

comes. Note that the

at any time by pressing the
