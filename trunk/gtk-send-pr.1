.Nd 
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Ar \-a file
.Op Fl mvh
.Sh DESCRIPTION
gtk-send-pr is a problem reporting tool 
.Po based on GTK+
.Pc 
, similar to send-pr.
.Pp
The following options can be used:
.Pp
.Ar \-a file
Include file in the Fix: section
.br
.Fl m
Enable maintainer mode
.br
.Fl v
Show version and exit
.br
.Fl h

.br
.Sh The user interface
The user interface has two parts: the tabs and the buttons. The buttons should be self explanatory 
for most people. 
.Do
Send
.Dc will send the PR to the selected SMTP server.
.Do
About
.Dc shows the version information dialog.
.Do
Help
.Dc pops up a window with this information, and, finally,
.Do
Quit
.Dc exits the program, warning the user if the PR has not been sent yet.
.Sh Parts of a PR
The first tab contains user info, as well as SMTP settings. Do not forget 
to properly set the SMTP server, or the program will fail when trying to 
send the PR. If the server requires SMTP AUTH, you will be prompted for a user
name and password. If the server runs on a non-standard port (other than 25), set the port
to the appropriate value. Most users don't need to change that. Also users should not modify the 
.Do
To
.Dc address.
.Pp
The 
.Do
Type
.Dc tab contains information about the PR, like the 
.Do
Synopsis
.Dc and other information. The pull down menus will show the available options for each field.
.Pp
.Do
System
.Dc contains information about your system. Again, most users do not need 
to add anything here.
.Pp
.Do
Details
.Dc is a very important section. Here is where the explanation about what the PR is 
comes. Note that the
.Do
-a
.Dc option will include a file in the 
.Do
Fix
.Dc section, which is usually used to send patches and shars. You can also include a file in the Fix section
at any time by pressing the 
.Do
Open
.Dc button.
.Pp
Once you have finished filling the relevant fields, press
.Do
Send
.Dc to send the problem report.
.Sh Maintainer Mode
As of version 0.4.2, you can enable 
.Do
maintainer mode
.Dc with the 
.Do
-m
.Dc command line option. Maintainer mode presets some options to make ports (packages in NetBSD) 
maintainers life easier. The 
.Do
category
.Dc will be set to ports (pkg in NetBSD) and the 
.Do
class
.Dc will be set to maintainer-update (change-request in NetBSD). The 
.Do
Synopsis
.Dc field will read 
.Do
[Maintainer Update]
.Dc .
